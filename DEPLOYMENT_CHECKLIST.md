## Post-Deployment Checklist üéØ

### Step 7: Verify Deployment

**Test Root Endpoint:**

```bash
curl https://your-service.onrender.com/
```

- [ ] Returns service info

**Test Health Endpoint:**

```bash
curl https://your-service.onrender.com/health
```

- [ ] Returns `{"status": "healthy"}`

**Test Ping Endpoint:**

```bash
curl https://your-service.onrender.com/ping
```

- [ ] Returns `{"status": "pong"}`

**Test API Documentation:**

- [ ] Visit `https://your-service.onrender.com/docs`
- [ ] Swagger UI loads correctly

**Test Main API:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-service.onrender.com/api/v1/recipes/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ingredients": ["chicken", "tomato"]}'
```

- [ ] Recipe generation works

### Step 8: Setup Keep-Alive Service

Choose ONE method:

**Option A: Cron-Job.org (Recommended)**

1. Go to https://cron-job.org/
2. Create free account
3. Add new cronjob:
   - Title: RCM Recipe Keep Alive
   - URL: `https://your-service.onrender.com/ping`
   - Schedule: Every 5 minutes
4. Enable and save

- [ ] Cron-Job.org configured

**Option B: UptimeRobot**

1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com/
2. Create free account (50 monitors)
3. Add new monitor:

   - Name: RCM Recipe API
   - URL: `https://your-service.onrender.com/ping`
   - Interval: 5 minutes
4. Create monitor

- [ ] UptimeRobot configured

**Option C: GitHub Actions**

1. Copy `.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml` to your repo
2. Push to GitHub
3. Go to repo Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions
4. Add secret: `RENDER_SERVICE_URL` = your service URL
5. Enable Actions in repo settings

- [ ] GitHub Actions configured

### Step 9: Configure Monitoring & Alerts
